Hate Speech Detection
This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a labeled dataset to classify whether a given text contains hate speech or not. This project can be used to automate the moderation of online platforms by identifying toxic content.

Introduction
Hate speech detection has become an essential tool for maintaining a healthy online environment. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect hate speech in textual data. By analyzing words and phrases, the model can classify text into categories like hate speech or neutral speech.

Features
Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
Machine learning model for classification
Support for CSV input
Evaluate model accuracy using standard metrics (Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
Technologies
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (for model training)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
Numpy (for mathematical operations)
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing text data labeled as 'hate speech' or 'neutral speech'. Each entry in the dataset includes a text string and a label indicating whether the text contains hate speech.

Dataset Fields:
text: The content of the message.
label: The category (0 for neutral, 1 for hate speech).
Installation
To install the dependencies, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd hate-speech-detection
Prepare your dataset (CSV format).
Run the script to train and evaluate the model:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Model Training
The model is trained using supervised learning algorithms. The training process involves:

Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Training classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Logistic Regression to identify hate speech.
Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using several metrics, including:

Accuracy: How often the model makes correct predictions.
Precision: The proportion of positive predictions that were actually correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
F1 Score: A weighted average of precision and recall.
You can generate an evaluation report by running the evaluate.py script:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate.py
